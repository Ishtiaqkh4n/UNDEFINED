# UNDEFINED
undefined

Where C stops making guarantees.

About

This repo is a playground for C experiments.
Here, we explore undefined behavior, edge cases, and low-level tricks that make the compiler sweat.

Think of it as C without promises — sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. That’s the fun.

Features

Raw C code — minimal, direct, no nonsense

Experiments with pointers, memory, and undefined behavior

Learning-focused: break things, understand why

Usage

Clone it:

git clone <repo-url>


Compile with gcc or your favorite C compiler:

gcc file.c -o output
./output


Watch things break. Learn something new.

Notes

Expect crashes. This is intentional.

Read code carefully. Undefined behavior can be sneaky.

No support promised. You’re on your own here.
