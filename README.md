# UNDEFINED

## About

This repo is a playground for **C experiments**.
Here, we explore **undefined behavior**, edge cases, and low-level tricks that make the compiler sweat.

Think of it as **C without promises** — sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. That’s the fun.



                                                  ## Features

* Raw C code — minimal, direct, no nonsense
* Experiments with pointers, memory, and undefined behavior
* Learning-focused: break things, understand why



                                                     **Usage**

1 Clone it:

bash
git clone <repo-url>


2 Compile with `gcc` or your favorite C compiler:

bash
gcc file.c -o output
./output





* **Expect crashes.** This is intentional.
* **Read code carefully.** Undefined behavior can be sneaky.
* **No support promised.** You’re on your own here.

If you want, I can also make a **more “Gen-Z hacker aesthetic” version** with **emojis, code vibes, and chaotic humor**, but still clean and readable.
Do you want me to do that?
